I would like you to take a look at Manually.java inside FinalPac. I have used the external layer that you have posted in gitlab and I modified it a little. I don't face any issues in finding the JSON object till now , maybe there might be less test cases. The output for manually will be in ManuallyOutput file inside testtheproblem project. It also passes the cases, where you have posted in gitlab with JSON objects like keys,strings.

Warning : Do not look this mess:) without looking Manually.java

In mathematically, I have validated the nodepointer(I am not sure, there you mentioned simply node.) like you have posted in GitLab.
